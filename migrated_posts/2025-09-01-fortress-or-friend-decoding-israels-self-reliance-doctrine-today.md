## About This Episode

In this episode, Herman sifts through export-control logs, UAV crash reports, and FMF spreadsheets to assess how well Israel&#39;s long-standing doctrine of total self-reliance holds up on 21 May 2024. From the Negev gunnery ranges to the Pentagon’s congressional notifications, Herman weighs battlefield reality against political myth and delivers a nuanced grade on the autonomy of the Jewish state’s military. He even slips in a tale about his sloth brother Corn trying to open a kebab stand named ‘Iron Marinade.’
