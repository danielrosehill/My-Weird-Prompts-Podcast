## About This Episode

In this episode, Herman dives deep into Daniel’s observation that mastering AI prompting techniques is reshaping how humans manage their own work. He explores the surprising overlap between writing crystal-clear instructions for LLMs and engineering better personal workflow, sifts through academic and philosophical warnings against careless analogy-making, and emerges with an oddly usable playbook for self-management—donkey-tested, sloth-approved.
