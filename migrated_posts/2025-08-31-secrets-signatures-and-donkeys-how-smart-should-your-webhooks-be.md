## About This Episode

In this episode, Herman deep-dives into Daniel’s webhook security quandary—why Cloudflare might feel like a bouncer at the door of his N8N instance—then trots through industry best practices: header signatures, HMAC tamper seals, webhook-specific tokens, and the eternal question of whether an extra layer is paranoid or prudent.
