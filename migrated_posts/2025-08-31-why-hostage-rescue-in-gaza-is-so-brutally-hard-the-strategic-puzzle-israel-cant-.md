## About This Episode

Herman unpacks the baffling gap between Israel’s celebrated high-tech military and its dim hostage-recovery record in Gaza. He walks through the layered maze of tunnels, competing war aims, dense urban cover, and Hamas’s ruthless calculus that turn every rescue attempt into a high-stakes, low-odds gamble.
