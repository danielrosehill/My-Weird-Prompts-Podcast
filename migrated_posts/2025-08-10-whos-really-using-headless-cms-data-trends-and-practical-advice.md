## About This Episode

A clear, practical look at who adopts headless CMSs, how their penetration compares to traditional platforms like WordPress, and whether that share is growing. I summarize public data sources, describe the kinds of organizations most likely to choose headless, and give decision criteria and measurement tips for teams considering the shift.
