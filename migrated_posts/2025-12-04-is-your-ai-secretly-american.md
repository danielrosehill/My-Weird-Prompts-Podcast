## About This Episode

Welcome to My Weird Prompts! This week, Corn and Herman unpack a fascinating prompt from Daniel Rosehill: the inherent, often invisible, American-centric worldview embedded within leading Western AI models. We delve beyond explicit censorship, exploring how massive training datasets, heavily sourced from US-centric internet content like Reddit and Wikipedia, subtly condition AIs with American cultural norms, legal assumptions, and even political leanings. Discover how this accidental bias, manifesting in everything from healthcare advice to idiomatic expressions, diminishes AI&#39;s global utility and trustworthiness, and why understanding this &#39;cultural echo chamber&#39; is vital for a truly universal artificial intelligence.
