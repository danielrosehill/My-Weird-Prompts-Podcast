## About This Episode

In this episode, Herman demystifies the spooky phenomenon that inspired Daniel’s afternoon rant: dual monitors yanked into synchronization the moment they wake from HDMI sleep. With equal parts troubleshooting know-how and donkey nostalgia for the days of VGA jumpers, you’ll learn why the ‘hive mind’ appears, how to break the spell at the hardware and OS levels, and a few permanent fixes so you never again have to fumble in the dark with 30-volt glows.
