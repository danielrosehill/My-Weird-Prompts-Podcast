## About This Episode

Did you ever wonder if everything you generated with AI tools could be ... somehow digitally traced back to you? What if the incriminating evidence linking you to your deepfakes were - literally - hiding in plain sight? Today (minus my friendly AI bots) I delve into the disconcerting world of steganography, AI watermarking, and ask where the boundaries lie between user privacy and black-hat use prevention.
