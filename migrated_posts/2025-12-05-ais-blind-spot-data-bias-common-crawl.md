## About This Episode

In this eye-opening episode of "My Weird Prompts," hosts Corn and Herman dive deep into the unseen influences shaping large language models. They explore the critical topic of AI training data, uncovering how its origins and composition create subtle, inherent biases—a "blind spot" often overlooked in discussions of AI censorship. Moving beyond overt suppression, they reveal how data scraped from predominantly American-centric platforms like Reddit and YouTube, along with foundational projects like Common Crawl, instills a default worldview in AI, impacting everything from its examples to its understanding of global contexts. This isn&#39;t malicious design, but an emergent property of the data, creating a complex mirror reflecting the internet&#39;s dominant voices. The episode raises profound questions about the authenticity of AI experiences, the challenge of creating truly universal AI, and the ethical dilemmas of using historical internet data without explicit consent for these powerful new applications. Join us as we peel back the layers to understand the true foundations of AI intelligence and its inherent limitations.
