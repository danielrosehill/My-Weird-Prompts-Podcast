## About This Episode

AI is everywhere today, from conversational chatbots to breathtaking visual art and realistic video. But how did all these seemingly different applications emerge so suddenly and at the same time?This episode of AI Conversations takes a deep look at the “secret sauce” behind the revolution: the transformer architecture. This breakthrough model introduced “self-attention,” a way for AI systems to understand context without relying on slow, sequential processing. It marked a major leap forward in how machines interpret language, images, and patterns.But the story isn’t only about transformers. What truly unlocked modern AI was a perfect storm of three forces working together:Transformers as the new foundational architectureMassive datasets scraped from the public internetExplosive growth in GPU computing power, enabling models to train at unprecedented scaleTogether, these factors created the triumvirate that transformed science fiction into a daily reality, powering advances across language, imagery, and video generation.Join us as we unpack how these ingredients converged to reshape the technological landscape.
