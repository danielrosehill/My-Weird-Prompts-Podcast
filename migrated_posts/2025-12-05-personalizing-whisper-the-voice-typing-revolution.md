## About This Episode

Welcome back to &#39;My Weird Prompts,&#39; where hosts Corn and Herman unpack the fascinating challenges sent by producer Daniel Rosehill. This week, we dive deep into the world of voice typing and the intricate art of fine-tuning OpenAI&#39;s Whisper model, exploring how tailoring AI to *your* unique voice transcends mere accuracy to achieve seamless integration that revolutionizes productivity. Discover why Daniel embarked on fine-tuning Whisper with his own voice audio, the critical difference between &#39;good enough&#39; speech-to-text and truly personalized AI, and the technical hurdles of deploying sophisticated models across vastly different hardware—from powerful desktop workstations to resource-constrained mobile phones. We dissect the challenges of Whisper&#39;s &#39;chunking&#39; for long-form dictation and ponder whether even the smallest models can achieve peak performance with dedicated training, making technology truly serve *us* rather than us adapting to it.
