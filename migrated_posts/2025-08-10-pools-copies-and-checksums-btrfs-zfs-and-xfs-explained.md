## About This Episode

A conversational deep-dive into how Btrfs, ZFS, and XFS approach multi-disk storage, snapshots, and data integrity. I explain, in accessible terms, the engineering ideas beneath pooling, copy‑on‑write snapshots, checksums, and RAID-like features, and offer practical guidance on which filesystem fits different use cases today.
