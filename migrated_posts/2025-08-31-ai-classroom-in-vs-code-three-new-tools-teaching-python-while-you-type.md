## About This Episode

In this episode, Herman unpacks the sudden emergence of AI tools that sit right inside your editor and teach you Python (among other languages) as you work. He demos GitHub Copilot’s new ‘Copilot Learning Lab’, the open-source ‘TutorPilot’ extension, and Replit’s AI Classroom Mode, grading their ability to turn throw-away projects into low-stress mastery sessions.
